				<p><strong>DBCA Global is a U.S.-based supply chain and consulting company specializing in procurement, distribution, and representation of international raw materials for manufacturing and specialty chemical industries.</strong></p>
				
				<p>Founded by <strong>Donis Bosworth</strong>, a 20-year veteran of global trade and former Vice President of North American Minerals Corporation, DBCA Global was established to bring clarity and reliability to complex international supply chains.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="content-block">
				<h2>What We Do</h2>
				<p>We operate at the intersection of manufacturing, logistics, and strategy — connecting global suppliers with trusted North American partners. Our work spans:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Procurement and Representation:</strong> Building and managing exclusive partnerships between international producers and U.S. manufacturers.</li>
					<li><strong>Supply Chain Optimization:</strong> Handling import logistics, warehousing, and national distribution with full compliance and cost control.</li>
					<li><strong>Strategic Consulting:</strong> Guiding global suppliers on U.S. market entry, financing, and partnership models.</li>
					<li><strong>Operational Support:</strong> Providing infrastructure for consignment programs, bonded storage, and just-in-time delivery solutions.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>DBCA Global manages material flow and compliance from origin to end-user, reducing risk while increasing transparency and performance across the chain.</p>

			<div class="content-block">
				<h2>Our Partners</h2>
				<p>Our partners include global producers of chemicals, minerals, and feed products, alongside major U.S. manufacturing facilities. We work across sectors where efficiency, trust, and technical knowledge determine success.</p>
				
				<p>We believe in business built on performance, not promises.<br>
				We value relationships that last because they are earned.<br>
				And we measure success not by growth alone, but by the strength and integrity of every link we build.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="content-block">
				<h2>Our Three Non-Negotiables</h2>
				
				<h3>Integrity — We strive to do what's right, especially when it's not easy.</h3>
				<p>Every decision aims to honor people, planet, and partnership. Ethics aren't a tagline — they're a standard. Our materials are responsibly sourced, our words are backed by data, and our promises hold even when no one is watching.</p>

				<h3>Intention — We move with purpose and precision.</h3>
				<p>Every action has direction and discipline. We protect what matters — our partners, our planet, and the long-term health of every operation we touch. Transparency isn't optional; it's built into how we think, act, and deliver.</p>

				<h3>Impact — We leave every place, person, and partnership stronger than we found it.</h3>
				<p>From the lab to the loading dock, we are science-driven and sustainability-focused — creating systems that perform, opportunities that elevate, and growth that endures.</p>

				<p><strong>At DBCA Global, we don't just build supply chains — we humanize them and maximize their potential.</strong><br>
				We bring intellect to logistics, intention to leadership, and innovation to industries that have carried the stress and weight of inefficiency for far too long.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Our Founder</h2>
				<p><strong>Donis Bosworth</strong><br>
				Founder & Managing Director</p>
				
				<p>With 20 years of experience leading global procurement and supply chains, Donis brings deep industry expertise and a commitment to integrity-driven business practices.</p>

				<p>Her vision for DBCA Global is simple: create a supply chain network that works for everyone — vendors, customers, and logistics partners alike.</p>

				<h3>Founder's Message</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>At DBCA Global, we don't measure success by volume or velocity, but by the value we add, the integrity we uphold, and the people who grow alongside us.</p>

					<p>I built this company on one belief: that doing what's right — even when it's hard — is the only strategy that lasts. We are here to prove that precision, transparency, and accountability can redefine power in business.</p>

					<p>Our work connects continents, industries, and individuals — but our purpose is far deeper. From start to finish, every person and every process should benefit, evolve, and find pride in the outcome. When we align intention with execution, growth becomes inevitable — and everyone wins.</p>

					<p>We're not chasing shortcuts or playing corporate games. We build with heart, with data, and with direction. Because the real reward isn't the next contract — it's the knowledge that we created something honest, lasting, and undeniably ours.</p>

					<p>At DBCA Global, we don't just build supply chains — we humanize them and maximize their potential. We bring intellect to logistics, intention to leadership, and innovation to industries that have carried the weight of inefficiency for far too long.</p>

					<p>We're building something to be proud of — rooted in integrity, fueled by ambition, and elevated by the belief that business can be both fierce and fair.</p>

					<p>Because in the end, we all return to what truly matters: our families, our friends, and the brief time we have to make a difference. Let's use it well — let's build something that lasts.</p>
